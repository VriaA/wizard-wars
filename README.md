Damage is inflicted on characters from randomized dice rolls triggered by the attack button. Each character's health reduces in proportion to the numbers on the dice of the rival character.

Each character has a health bar that reduces in length in proportion to the percentage of damage the character takes. 
A character's health bar turns red if its health is between 25% - 0% of its initial health.

If the wizard dies, the game is over, but if a monster dies, it is replaced by another monster until the wizard successfully kills all the monsters.

A message that declares the winner is rendered at the end of the game.
